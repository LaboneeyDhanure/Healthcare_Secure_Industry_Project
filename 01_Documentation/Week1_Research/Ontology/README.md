# Insurance Ontology-Based Recommendation System

##  Overview
This project explores how **ontology** can be used in the insurance domain to structure knowledge, define relationships, and automate decision-making for insurance recommendations.  
Unlike traditional systems that only use raw data, ontology allows us to represent **domain knowledge** (customers, policies, risks, premiums) in a structured way that machines can "understand."

##  Features
- Ontology-based knowledge modeling.
- Defined relationships between **Customer → Risk Profile → Policy → Coverage → Premium**.
- Rule-based premium calculation.
- Supports personalized insurance recommendations.

##  System Flow
1. **Data Collection** – Gather customer data (age, vehicle type, medical history, claim history).  
2. **Ontology Mapping** – Organize data into ontology classes and relationships.  
3. **Rules Application** – Apply business rules (discounts, premium hikes based on risks).  
4. **Processing** – Match rules + ontology for final premium calculation.  
5. **Output** – Recommend suitable insurance policies to customers.
